WebGL
=====

##About
This project was done to help me understand webgl a little bit better. I thought
I'd make it a process so that others could follow my learning process as I went
through it.

I mainly just started with what I'd learned in 
[CS455 Computer Graphics](https://cs.byu.edu/course/cs-455) and coupled that 
with online tutorials and resources, which I'll try to list in the resources 
section as I use them.

My goal was to learn the low level webgl pipeline, so I didn't use any 
abstractions or libraries. I did do an asteroids tutorial at open west using
cannon.js and three.js. You can look at the source for that if you'd like to 
stay at the high level.

##Exercises
1. Draw a triangle  
 In this exercise I wanted to draw a triangle on the screen with no worry about
 view space. So there is no projection matrix, or matricies at all.
